## Overview of Election Audit
I assisted a Colorado Board of Elections employee to audit election results. We used Python to retrieve the following data from a CSV file and save it to a text file:

1. Total number of votes cast
2. A list of counties
3. Percentage of votes in each county
4. Number of votes in each county
5. The county with largest turnout
6. A list of candidates
7. Percentage of votes won by each candidate
8. Number of votes won by each candidate
9. The election winner based on popular vote
